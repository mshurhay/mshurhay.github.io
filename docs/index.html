                    <p>I am a Planning Technician in the Village of Romeoville’s Community Development department. I have been in my role for 3 years. I am currently wrapping up my final year in the Northern Illinois University’s Master of Public Administration program with an emphasis in local government management. I received my bachelor’s degree in History and Political Science from Illinois State University.</p>

                    <p>A little about my personal life, I grew up in the Southwest suburbs of Chicago in Romeoville, IL. My interests include running, biking, and golfing. I also enjoy spending time with my friends and family.  My goal is to work my way up in local government to city management.</p>

                            <p>Coursework in Local Economic Development gave me a greater understanding of my current role in the community development department and economic development. Throughout the course, I wrote weekly briefs on different issues throughout local government like TIF districts, revolving loan funds, and rising markets. Samis White (White and Kotval 2013) helped me understand how certain funds impacted communities. Working through sites like U.S. Bureau of Census gave me greater knowledge of markets in the Village of Romeoville. This site helped not only complete the final assignment for the course but also better understand Romeoville’s demographics. The course work was then able to help me develop my skills in working on developments in my current professional role.</p>
                            <p>Effectively work with a diverse group of internal and external stakeholders</p>

                            <p>Effectively working with a diverse group of stakeholder’s competencies was achieved through my course work in strategic planning. I was able to perform group work with classmates from different backgrounds such as political and county level. Working on a strategic plan presented something I have never done in local government. The course on strategic planning laid the foundation to start the planning process. The course readings from (Bryson, 2018) helped me and our group give an understanding of how to address the City of Naperville’s strategic plan. Naperville has well thought out plan that includes multiple areas of growth and improvement. (Bridging the Past to Possibility) Working through the plan and the course has allowed me to analyze strategic plans and develop a plan for a municipality. With the help of this course, I was able to present confidently to my supervisor why a strategic plan was essential for my organization. 
                            
                            <p>Develop or adapt policies, programs, goods or services to accommodate changing social demographics for the population they serve</p>

                            <p>This competency was first strengthened through my coursework in Information Technology in Public Service. The course highlighted case studies that identified what type of enterprise resource planning (ERP) system should be selected. Readings in the course (Turban, Efraim 2018) illustrated how systems operate and how they impact an organization whether the systems are in house, hybrid, and cloud systems. This helped me immensely when I was tasked to implement a new code enforcement software call DACRA for the Village of Romeoville. The Village never had a system for tracking and an opportunity came along to help implement it.</p>
